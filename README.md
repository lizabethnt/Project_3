PROJECT PROPOSAL
Chosen Topic:
Where are alternative car fueling/charging stations?  Which stations are available for which type of fuel?  Which are publicly available?  Historically, how many were opened each year?
 
Dataset:
https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::alternative-fueling-stations/explore?location=43.310119%2C-122.059432%2C7.80&showTable=true
 
Relevant inspirational visualizations:
https://geodata.bts.gov/maps/edit?content=usdot%3A%3Aalternative-fueling-stations

Sketch of the final design:
-Create a map with markers showing each alternative fuel station, with drop down selections to filter markers by public/private and by fuel type
-Create a Line graph showing year(x axis) versus number of facilities (newly) opened during that year.  A Line for each fuel type.
-Create a choropleth by zip code fo the number of charging stations
